            <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br>
            This is the emotional level you feel about yourself and how stable you feel yourself to be.<br>
            <br>
            I can be looked at in many different ways and is very important in a person daily life.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How it is different to IQ?</strong><br>
            IQ is your level of problem solving ability and how you look and problems and is you are smart enough to be able to figure out difficult problems.<br> But EQ has nothing to do with our over all intelligense in problem solving, 
            <br> it is to do with how you feel. If you are happy with what you are doing and everthing is going fine emotionally<br> or if not what will you do to help your emotional level, such as meditaion,<br> stop doing the things you don't like doing and doing more of what you do like and taking breaks from work to relaxe in daily life.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>
            It is very important to keep your emotional level stable,<br> so you are able to do the things you like and can move on throughout life being happier.<br> If your emotional levels are low sometimes you just dont feel like doing anything or seeing anyone and could really put a toll on your health.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>My Meditaion</h3>
            <strong>What did you notice as you were meditating?</strong><br>
            Well 'as' I was meditating I dont think of anything, as your should,<br> any thoughts just flout away and as I am meditating I don't focus on anything. But after meditating I am calm and relaxed from 10 - 20 minutes of relaxation.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How did you find the overall experience?</strong><br>
            Personally I love meditation and kwhat it does to help me, and believe everyone should do a bit of meditation in their life, even if it only once a week.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>What's your daily habit commitment?</strong><br>
            I try to do meditation and the end of every day and to think about the day.<br>
