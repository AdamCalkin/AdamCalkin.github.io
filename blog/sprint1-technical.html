            <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa </h1>
            <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
            <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
            
            <p>
              Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

                Describe the process for solving problems<br>
                The proccess of solving problems is not what everybody would think it too be. Some people usually think to solve a problem it is to just sit there and think what to do but that probably wont work most of the time, what you should do is not something to do with the problem (just do make sure to go over the code or whatever and make sure its not something that you can fix just by going back like a spelling mistake) but just relax right down the problem, draw out a diagram of your prblem, draw out what the process of the problem was, tell someone what the problem is and try to just meditate sometimes after a good meditation you can be very relaz and clean so once you sit down it just comes to you.<br>
