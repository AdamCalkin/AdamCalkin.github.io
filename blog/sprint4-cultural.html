            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            Neauro relating to the nervous stystem and plasticity relating to the quality of being shaped or moduled,<br> Neuroplasticity simply meaning shaping or moduling the nervous system to grow physical movments be just mentally practising.<br> 
            Simply focusing on mentally thinking of changing something physically can actually make a real chanhge,<br> to the body by,  shaping the part of your brain to know that skill and mentally practice it.<br> This would make it so when it comes to actually physically doing the action it would be a lot easier than just starting out fresh<br>

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            A Growth Mindset is simpply meaning to have a open mind to grow and explore specific information, to not give up if a challenge comes your way.<br>
            This is a very important factor with going into something new in life so you can grow and learn to focus on what is new,<br> so as this jouney into Enspiral Dev Academy many of us are doing and for me I like to always keep an open mind not just in new study,<br> just so with this kind of mindset you can except the challenges coming your way and enjoy them and learn for it to gather information.<br>
