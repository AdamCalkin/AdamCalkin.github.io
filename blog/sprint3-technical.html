            <Strong>The difference of HTML asnd CSS.</strong><br>
            HTML is the foundations for the website and the directions on what you want it to do.<br>
            CSS is the styling in the site bring the color and brghtness to the site.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What is the DOM?</strong><br>The DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model.<br> It is how a devloper and or anyone can see the code for the site to edit and see works in it without editing the actual site,<br> it can also be used for fun editing random websites to say what you like.<br>
            The DOM when edited,&nbsp; doesnt effect the actual website because when the site is viewed it is pulled from the server and displays on your device,<br> editing the site on your local device only edits the local website.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Explain control flow and loops.</strong><br>
            A control flow is the order of individual statements, instructions and functions for a program to execute.<br>
            For example,&nbsp; everyone usally has a rough set of instructions of what they are doing that morning or day.<br>
            For me I have waking up,&nbsp; checking the time,&nbsp; getting ready for the day,&nbsp; having a small breakfast then catching a lift into the town to the station.<br> From then walking to EDA, after that its just catching the bus home.<br> That is my controled flow that is executed everyday all in a daily loop just like any control flow going in a loop.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Difference between arrays and objects.</strong><br>
            Arrays are variables that store multiple values into a single variable, such as when creating a variable<br> if it is created with many values in it for example names, it is an array.<br>
            Objects are variables that have propertries about that specific variable,<br> such as when describing a car it has a model number, type of vehical, colour and so on. <br>So when desscribing this car the variable can be called car and in the variable it has values as the other important properties of the car.<br>
            The clear difference between these 2 variables is that one (array) defines 1 or many values for a variable<br> and the other (objects) detailing the properties of the variable to go into more detail.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What are functions?</strong><br>
            Functions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task when ran. The function is called when something calls it to run.<br>
            A function is definied with a keyword to call the function, which can also have other next to it in parentheses other variables to be defined in this function.<br>
            Functions can have in them variables defineing one thing then also returning to a different variable.
