          <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong><br>
          My strengths are being able to finish work that I really want to do, if I get stuck into something eg a website I can easily finish it.<br> I know what it takes for me to to a break and when I need to calm down.<br>
          <br>
          My weaknessess are time constrictions I am really bad at staying to a time / schedule and thinking I have time when I don't.<br> I can find it difficult to communicate and seek help when I need it. Also if I dont like to do something I find it hard to concentrate to it <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.<br> This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong><br>
          On big tasks I will try and finish them first and getting that fully done but with taking many breaks throughout the tasks.<br> Try in the future to seek more help from others, set a times in the day when I should start and finihs the day<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong><br>
          Whenever I get stuck on a issue, I look at some W3schools info and online resourse or some validations,<br> but after I cant figure it out myself I would ask the foundations channel<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong><br>
          I expect that they will help me along the way and if I have any queries help but not having to lean on the whole way<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</strong><br>
          I dont have any commit as of yet that I have to do but I would like to commit to thursday being my break day in the week, being the middle of the week<br>
