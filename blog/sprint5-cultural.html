            <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
            I have realised that I am not good at tryinng to work hard through tasks the I really dont like,<br> I believe in myself that I can do the work its just when I comes down to it im not good at getting it done<br> and I look at my self as know not much about programming but I beleve I have a good knowledge and understand even prior to joining the course.<br>

            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
            The it most quite important and I loved ging through it and learning more about core skills and myself.<br>
            
            <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            Reflecting on myself an having to think about me as a person and my strengths and weakness that I have no learning and as a person.<br>

            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
            Becasue it is very important to have a good mindset on not only the work but on your self on what your<br> stengths and weaknessess are so that you can complete the work with comfidence in your abilities.<br>

            <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            It doesnt feel like a waste of time becasue it helped my strengthen my mindset and be able to reflect on my abilities and how I am as a person.<br>
