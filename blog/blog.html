                <br>

                Yes and No it can differ from persmon to person, some people can have more or less anxiety. But no matter who you are you can always improve easy or hard <br>
                <br>

                Tech skills is the skill that are used on devices, the code and all the technocal things on a computer. Core skills are human skills like communication between employees and or employors, or anyone in the industry the you come across to be nicer and kind <br>

                Describe the process for solving problems<br>
                The proccess of solving problems is not what everybody would think it too be. Some people usually think to solve a problem it is to just sit there and think what to do but that probably wont work most of the time, what you should do is not something to do with the problem (just do make sure to go over the code or whatever and make sure its not something that you can fix just by going back like a spelling mistake) but just relax right down the problem, draw out a diagram of your prblem, draw out what the process of the problem was, tell someone what the problem is and try to just meditate sometimes after a good meditation you can be very relaz and clean so once you sit down it just comes to you.<br>
