            <h3>Experience with Problem Solving</h3>
            Back when I was in college,&nbsp; I had to make a quiz game using python for an assessment.&nbsp;
            I couldnt figure out for the life of me how to get different function to link to seperate functions so after an hour of trying many things I thought of taking this to the internet.&nbsp;
            But first taking a littke break to clear my head,&nbsp; then when I got back I spent the next 10 minutes looking for a way to do this and after finding something that might help I tried it with my situation and I almost instantly thought of an idea to fix my problem,&nbsp; but I also found a way to improve my code.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What was the problem?</strong><br>
            The problem ending up being that I hadnt actually group most things together in class,<br> so once I did that and added a class I was able to link to other functions<br> and connect things together a whole lot easier.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What problem soving techniques did you use?</strong><br>
            I first used just trying differnt things in the code and seeing what I could think of,<br> but after that didnt work I took a break to clear my head and tried just googling it.<br> I also ued thee rubber ducky method talking to a friend to think aloud and it just came to me.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How did you feel thoughout the process?</strong><br>
            I knew that I would be able to figure it so once I got in the zone and really wanted to<br> figure it out myself using my own techniques, I was feeling fine like I knew<br> I had to figure it out and that helped me figure it out.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What did you learn?</strong><br>
            I learnt that its good to take a break once and a while to clear your head and that<br> speaking the problem aloud really helps,&nbsp; along with finding out about classes and how use them.<br> 
            <br>
            <h3>How confident am I using different Problem Solving techniques and process</h3>
              <strong>Pseudocode</strong><br>
              I am confident with this technique but I just choose not to use it<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Trying something</strong><br>
              This technique is always my first to use and try and see if I do know it but just cant think of it<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong><br>
              I like to use this method if not manye other methods are working are using really helps<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>
              I have got quite good and getting the answer from the error message and is quite usefull
              <br>
              <strong>Console logging</strong><br>
              I am confident with logging and I do think its a useful one but I just don't use it much<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Googling</strong><br>
              This technique I dont usually think of it as a technique I just do this when im stuck<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong><br>
              This can sometimes help, if they know more the better but usually not too much but unless its small or connected to something they have done<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br>
              This usually helps 100% of the time and give tips and be very useful if stuck but unless they are terrible at coaching you<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong><br>
              I have only resently started doing this with starting this course but I love it and will continue to use to help remember the problem and conclude it<br>
